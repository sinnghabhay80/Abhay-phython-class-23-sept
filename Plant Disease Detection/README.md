# Plant Disease Detection

Basic Idea for creating this project was to learn about creating deep neural networks and work with large cnn networks.

### Dataset

The dataset was obtained from tensorflow, specifically, PlantVillage dataset, it contains data about 39 differnt disease spanning across 14 different fruits/veggies.

### Model

Please train the model using the jupyter notebook file and place it inside the Web App(Flask) folder named model.hdf5 to replicate.
